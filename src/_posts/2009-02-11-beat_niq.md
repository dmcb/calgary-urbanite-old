<p>So, if you haven't heard of the <a title="Beat Niq" href="http://www.beatniq.com/">Beat Niq</a>, it's a jazz club located on  <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=811+1+St+SW,+Calgary,+AB">811 - 1 St SW</a>, and without question it's a pretty awesome place to go to.&nbsp; It's nice and cozy.&nbsp; The food is alright (it's attached to the Pic Niq restaurant above), but you're not there for the food.&nbsp; You're there for the music, and it's good, not that I know the first thing about jazz music, but when I've been to the Beat Niq, it's been nothing but enjoyable.&nbsp; So, all's good with the Beat Niq right?&nbsp; Well, there is something that makes me have a love/hate relationship with the place.</p>

<p>That something is an oustanding issue I have with the refreshments.&nbsp; At the Beat Niq, if you want water, you only have one choice, bottled water.&nbsp; Fancy bottled water to fool you into thinking it's a viable product to begin with.&nbsp; You know the type.&nbsp; The water isn't in a plastic bottle but a glass one, and it has packaging that if closely read, contains such a vivid description of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrogen_monoxide_hoax">dihydrogen monoxide</a> that it will have you thinking you're in the hills of Tuscany and your long lost Italian grand mother is preparing you a fresh meal from her vegetable garden.&nbsp; That kind of bottled water.&nbsp; It's the same kind of bottled water that has to be shipped thousands and thousands of kilometers on sea and land to reach your table, when Rocky mountain glacier water that most of the world would be envious of, if not go to war for, flows right from the tap at the bar a few feet away.</p>
<blockquote><img src="/file/post/beat_niq/well_travelled.jpg" alt="" /><br />There were two types of bottled water, the distilled water, and featured here, Blu, the 'sexier' sparkling water.  Blu doesn't have the vivid countryside description that the destilled water has because that's not sexy, and with these bottles, image is everything.&nbsp; Regardless of its image the end product tastes the same whether it be from Rimini, Italy or Calgary, Alberta.</blockquote>
<p>As nice as the packaging is in its attempts to transport you to rural Italia on a cold Calgary night, the bottled water policy at the Beat Niq has no place there or anywhere.&nbsp; It's pretentious, ignorant and completely unsustainable.&nbsp; I didn't think the jazz crowd was into that sort of thing, I always had the impression that jazz folk were sort of like hippies.&nbsp; Forgive all my absurd generalizations, but hippies love causes and ending the practice of unnecessary bottled water certainly seems like a good cause to take up.</p>

<h3>Bottom line:</h3>
<p>Go to the Beat Niq, it's a wonderful departure from the cowboy/rock bars that dominate the Calgary scene, but when you go, if bottled water's the only H2O going, let them know that's out of style.</p>
