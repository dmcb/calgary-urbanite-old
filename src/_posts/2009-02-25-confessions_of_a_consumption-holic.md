<p>Despite the media attention, reading the books and the articles, learning about it in school and having a best friend who is truly an environmentalist at heart, I am guilty of being a consumption-holic.&nbsp; I am conscious of the fact that a) I already have a lot of stuff and b) I don&rsquo;t need anything else but I still find myself buying a lot of items that I justify with these reasons: <br /></p><!-- pagebreak -->
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s cheap, I should stock up in case I need it in the future, </li>
<li>It&rsquo;s so pretty, having this will make me just a little bit more happy and confident (I know I&rsquo;m already happy and confident, but now I can be just this much happier and this much more confident), and </li>
<li>This is so innovative and practical, this will be more useful than what I have now.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />I am a true shop-o-holic but I thought I got a little smarter.&nbsp; Every time I am faced with the decision to buy something, I hold it and think about how badly I need it and what I already have that is similar or could use in place of it.&nbsp; I weigh things out and sometime I will hold the item and walk around it in the store while I look at other things.&nbsp; Sometimes if I&rsquo;m really undecided, I will leave the store without it and see if I still think about it later.&nbsp; This has been quite a hard practice for me but I had been doing pretty good and held off a lot of purchases but I think I'm relapsing. <br /><br />I&rsquo;ve run into the trouble lately of finding a lot of things that are on sale, look good on me, are very innovative or all of the above and I just want it all.&nbsp; Impulsive buying was something that I thought was in the past for me.&nbsp; I have to confess now that I just bought a new flat screen TV on impulse.&nbsp; My intention for going to Best Buy was actually to just pick up a movie.&nbsp; Mind you, this is my first TV and I now intend to move out by summer so it&rsquo;s kind of justified.&nbsp; If you knew me well though, you would know that I don&rsquo;t watch cable/satellite TV and rarely do I get the occasion to pop in a DVD.&nbsp; Still, I think it was a good purchase and it&rsquo;s there for me to enjoy whenever I want.&nbsp; I could almost say the same about for my car.<br /><br />My problem I think is that I enjoy doing a lot of various activities that require different things.&nbsp; In 2008 alone, I picked up snowboarding, yoga, soccer, ultimate frisbee, ceramic painting, and dance.&nbsp; This year already and it&rsquo;s only February, I&rsquo;ve picked up swimming and Spanish lessons.&nbsp; I also don&rsquo;t have just one style in clothes, I have about a million and they all reflect who I am.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve guessed it yet, but I&rsquo;m a Gemini characterized by multiple personalities.&nbsp; Since it&rsquo;s hard to change someone&rsquo;s personality I think it&rsquo;s hard to change what I consume.&nbsp; I am still going to make a conscious effort to think about what I&rsquo;m buying because I love the environment and I love my best friend the environmentalist.&nbsp; I agree with the problems that consumption poses for us and I don&rsquo;t like how I&rsquo;m contributing to those problems but I have a personal problem that is misaligned.&nbsp; One of these days, I might stop my hobby of taking up new hobbies but hey, at least I gave being an environmentalist a try. <br /><br />A video to watch: <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/">http://www.storyofstuff.com/</a><br />If I can&rsquo;t change, maybe I can get one of you to.</p>
