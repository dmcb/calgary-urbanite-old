<p>So, what is CalgaryUrbanite?</p>
<p>Well, good question.&nbsp; On any given weekday, I often find myself beelining it from the office straight home.&nbsp; I know I'm not the only doing this, because every day I'll be sandwiched in with the thousands of other cars also trying to make their way back home.&nbsp; It's on this daily commute that I usually get thinking, what is this city's culture?&nbsp; I know there's a lot more to this city than just work &amp; profits, oilsands &amp; resource development.&nbsp; Like a lot of people I know, I can find it frustratingly hard sometimes to find the real pulse of the city.&nbsp; But the truth is there's a lot going on in Calgary and lots of great people, and we're hoping to feature a lot of them here.&nbsp; Although we live in the heart of the oil economy, there's lots of us here who care about the environment, care about sustainable living, and care about making our city a better place.</p><!-- pagebreak --><p>So how can we contribute to this positive change?&nbsp; By sharing and stuff. We have a couple authors here to get things going.&nbsp; We'll be posting stories, rants, reviews, photos and the like.&nbsp; Sustainable living, community events, outdoor activities, local restaurants, social causes - all that warm fuzzy (and tasty) stuff.&nbsp; Best of all, we encourage you all to contribute too!&nbsp; We don't kid ourselves in thinking that our ability to write is any better than yours, if anything it's the opposite!&nbsp; Start posting your own entries, and if they contribute something new to the blog/site/magazine/whatever-you-want-to-call-it, they'll be featured.&nbsp; If you're really good, you'll get to be a featured author here, and we'd love to have you!</p>
<p>The name of this place is CalgaryUrbanite after all, so I won't lie, most articles here will deal with events and issues more tailored to sustainable living in the inner city.&nbsp; That's not to say there won't be content for all Calgarians, but it is to say that if your vision is the double garage &amp; white picket fence home, we might not share it.&nbsp; It's just not us.</p>
<p>To encourage everyone to contribute here, we will be running challenges whenever we get our hands on some decent prizes.&nbsp; The challenges will usually involve raising awareness for social issues or sustainable living.&nbsp; Often in Alberta, policy towards the environment and a sustainable economy are ignored.&nbsp; Despite this, we can lead by example in our day to day living, doing the small things that make a difference.&nbsp; It's this movement that is what CalgaryUrbanite is all about.</p>
<p>And about me?&nbsp; I'm just a lowly web designer who's trying to use his powers for good, instead of evil.&nbsp; I've been toying with this idea for a long time.&nbsp; Such a long time that I've had a mental block after mental block trying to design a layout, but eventually after the umpteenth design, I came upon this look.&nbsp; The inspiration?&nbsp; Street &amp; sidewalk chalk art.&nbsp; To me its a perfect fit, street chalk art is something organic from the community, and that's what I hope this place will be.</p>
