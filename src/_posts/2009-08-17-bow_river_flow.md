<p>The Bow River flow is coming up, and it's up to Calgarians to make it a success. Come down to Memorial drive between 10th and 4th st for a party on the pavement. I unfortunately will be out of town and won't be able to make the event, but I hope those of you in town come down and have a good time.</p><!-- pagebreak -->
<blockquote>Bow River Flow is an occasion for Calgarians to gather and celebrate life along the Bow River and Memorial Drive Parkway. Imagine a great flowing commons through the heart of our city &ndash; an event that is inclusive of and accessible to all Calgarians - an invitation for individuals, families, after-church congregations, tai chi enthusiasts, to come together to mingle, and to enjoy a leisurely walk or ride along Memorial Drive, or a float down the Bow River.</blockquote>
