<p>...Plastic bags that is.&nbsp; I still very much need my debit &amp; credit cards to go grocery shopping.</p>
<p>As you may or may not know, city council has been looking at the possibility of banning plastic bags at store check outs.&nbsp; Now we all know why plastic bags are bad: they don't degrade for hundreds and hundreds of years, except their chemicals photo degrade and leech into the eco system and ultimately our food chain; 4 to 5 trillion bags are used each year filling our landfills and <a href="http://www.vbs.tv/video.php?id=1485308505">our oceans</a> (and in many places they fill the streets); they require oil to be produced only to be thrown away; all that bad stuff.&nbsp; If you didn't know why plastic bags are bad, now you're up to speed.&nbsp; I'm here to talk about a possible future without plastic bags.</p>

<h3>The future is already here - elsewhere</h3>
<p>Many major centres of the world have begun their own <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080404-plastic-bags.html">plastic bag taxes and bans</a>, and how are they holding up?&nbsp; Well it turns out San Francisco is still kicking and Adelaide is going strong, and that these bans aren't nearly as scary as they sound, but do they help?&nbsp; Ireland has instituted a tax on every plastic bag used at the check outs.&nbsp; The amount of plastic bags purchased at the stores (presumably for lining garbages at home) has increased by 4 times.&nbsp; That's bad.&nbsp; However, plastic bag usage at store check outs has decreased 95%.&nbsp; That's good.&nbsp; So overall in Ireland there has been a net reduction of plastic bags in the country and the measure has been successful.</p>

<h3>Calgary without plastic, a dry run</h3>
<p>So, how would day to day life change in Calgary with out plastic bags?&nbsp; Well, it won't be some post-apocolyptic world with mutants running the streets.&nbsp; In fact, it's strangely the same place.&nbsp; Albeit a happier one where I no longer need to hold back my rage at the check out when someone asks to have all their bags 'double bagged' (or the unprecented triple bagging).</p>
<blockquote><img src="/file/post/shopping_without_plastic/plastic_bag_selection.jpg" alt="" /><br />GASP! What's this? My first shocking observation in this futuristic world, plastic bags are still available for sale.</blockquote>
<p>Dog owners seem to be the most vocal against a possible plastic bag ban because they reuse them to clean up doggy doo (although a large amount of the plastic bags we get from grocery stores have holes in them, compromising their doo packaging ability and thus reusability).&nbsp; But, as you can see above, dog owners will still be able to clean up their doo, they just won't get a free ride to do so anymore.&nbsp; Taking naturally biodegradable fecal matter, wrapping it in something that ensures it won't biodegrade for hundreds of years and throwing it away probably shouldn't be a free practice any way.&nbsp; Now that we will have to buy our garbage bags it may encourage using biodegradable bags so that we aren't packaging dog doo for future generations.</p>
<p>There's only one difference in the shopping experience, you bring your own reusable bags or boxes.&nbsp; I spent $3.96 on reusable shopping bags two years ago, and I estimate that's saved me from using more than 400 plastic bags over that time.&nbsp; Now, it's true I've purchased garbage bags, but I've probably used only 60 over that period.&nbsp; Imagine if every Calgarian reduced their use that much.</p>
<blockquote><img src="/file/post/shopping_without_plastic/worst_case.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /><br />Ugh, the worst case scenario, I've forgotten to bring my reusable bags. And make no mistake, this is absolutely worst case scenario with a plastic bag ban.  Hardly much of a concern - the world isn't ending - I simply load up my trunk with my groceries and drive home just like always.  The only difference is that I have to bring my bags down to my car when I get home to bring them in.  That and maybe I spend a little more care loading my groceries in the trunk to prevent them from rolling around much.</blockquote>

<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>For starters, <a href="http://www.reusablebags.com/">get your self some reusable bags</a>.&nbsp; We've talked the talk, it's time to walk the walk.&nbsp; Actually, a good rule of thumb in life is to only purchase reusable items if possible.&nbsp; If it's disposable, chances are it's an extremely unsustainable product.<br /><br />Now that you've got your reusable bags, it's time to enact your own ban on the plastic kind.&nbsp; So what if the city hasn't stopped you from getting plastic bags at the check out yet?&nbsp; I know lots of people that are only against the ban because it's a ban and they despise government intervention, and there's definitely some merit to that argument.&nbsp; So show everyone at the checkout you don't need city hall to make you an environmentally responsible individual.&nbsp; That said, it wouldn't hurt to let your alderman know you support action on plastic bags.</p>
