<p>It's funny the impression you can have of the world around you when you spend more time making assumptions than actually discovering that world.&nbsp; The phrase 'to assume makes an ass of you and me' couldn't be more true.&nbsp; Assuming things has definitely made an ass out of me.&nbsp; There, I admitted it, I'm an ass.&nbsp; Or at least I was.&nbsp; The assumption I used to make?&nbsp; That Calgary has a shriveled, sorry excuse for an environmentally minded community.&nbsp; Well, I'm happy to say that I'm wrong (another rare admittance I might add).</p><!-- pagebreak -->
<p>It may be a smaller community than it should be, but it's far from sorry.&nbsp; Calgary's environmentally minded community is thriving, vibrant and diverse.&nbsp; What it might lack in size it makes up for in determination and creativity.&nbsp; The community's demographic isn't simply just unemployed tree huggers, and we won't be marginalized as such.&nbsp; It's made up of all sorts of individuals, from the expected environmental science crowd, to web developers (had to give a shout out to my peeps), accountants, engineers, scientists, urban planners, managers, students and many more.&nbsp; Best of all, being in Calgary, this community has something to prove and as a result it is quite exciting to be a part of.</p>
<p>So just how did I find my way into our environmental community?&nbsp; It was by complete chance - I was reading the #yyc twitter channel back in January and someone mentioned an event called Green Drinks (have to give a shout out to all the #yyc twitter peeps out there, whatever that means).&nbsp; The 'tweet' had mentioned something about a good boy/girl ratio at the event, so naturally my interest piqued, but more seriously I had debuted this site and wanted to walk the walk that I decided to talk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I attended my first Green Drinks event in February.&nbsp; I went alone, undeterred, directly into a side of Calgary I hadn't seen before.&nbsp; Seeing Vicious Circle completely packed with green-minded people was intimidating to this intrepid loner, but also entirely relieving that the event wasn't simply a table in the corner of the bar surrounded by a few derelict souls.&nbsp; Awkwardness aside, I managed to meet some great people, and even got roped into a project that I'm very proud to be a part of, <a href="http://myworldmychoice.org/">my world, my choice!</a> (that's right, had to give a shout out to some of my other peeps).&nbsp; Now when I go to Green Drinks, not only am I no longer alone, but I feel a part of something that's contributing to the well being of our city.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't mean for this post to go all auto-biographical, but here we are.&nbsp; The real point of this diatribe?&nbsp; Head to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/event.php?eid=78646887898">Green Drinks tonight!</a>&nbsp; You'll meet some like minded individuals, your assumptions will be thrown out the window, and you'll find out first hand that Calgary is more than just an oil town.</p>
